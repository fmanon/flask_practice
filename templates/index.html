        <h1>Let's Encode some stuff!</h1>
        <p>A very simple gateway into the world of cryptography is the Caesar Cipher.</p>
        <p>It's a simple encryption process where each letter in a message is replaced by another letter some fixed number of positions away.  For example, if we wanted to ecryption "Hi" with a shift of 2, we would take the "H" and move over 2 positions to the right to replace it with the letter "J".  The same applies to the "i" - which is replaced by the letter "k".  This would give us the encrypted message "Jk".</p>

        <p>So why is this named the Caesar Cipher?  Well, simply because it was named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his own private messages.  Give it a try below:</p>

        <form method="post" action='results'>
            <p>How many positions would you like to "shift" by?</p>
            <input type="text" name="shift" placeholder="Please enter a number..."/>
            <br>
            <p>Enter your secret message below:</p>
            <input type="text" name="message" placeholder="üëÄü§´üëÄü§´üëÄü§´"/>
            <p></p>
            <input type="submit" value="Encrypt!"/>
        </form>
